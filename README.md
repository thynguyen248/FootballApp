# FootballApp

A demo application is using UIKit + Combine + MVVM architecture

### Deployment target: iOS 14.0

### Third party libraries used:
* SnapKit
* Kingfisher
* Reachability

### Challenges:
* I didn't work with diffable data source before.
* My approach: learn from tutorial and practice.
* What I've learned: should apply this new approach for the applications that targets iOS 13 and above due to a few benefits over using the classic data source.
